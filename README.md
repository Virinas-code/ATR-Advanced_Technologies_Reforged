# ATR - Advanced Technologies: Reforged

## About

This modpack is focused around technology, especially the Create, Valkyrien Skies and ComputerCraft mods. The final goal is to make technology required in order to progress (however, since it is still in Alpha, this goal has not been reached yet).

### Why Reforged?

I, personally, highly prefer Quilt and Fabric to Forge, but some of the mods in this modpack are only available for Forge and required for an optimal experience. Since it started as a Fabric modpack, but was then moved to Forge, it is called "Reforged".

## Rules

> *I sadly didn't find any ways to enforce these. Please follow those rules for an optimal gameplay experience.*

In order to play this modpack properly, you must :

1. Use True Darkness.
2. Enable the `reducedDebugInfo` gamerule.
3. Play in Hardcore (to make it easier you can increase your amount of hearts with the `/attribute` command).

## Installation

Currently, the only officialy supported method is via the [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app).

Other methods are available in [Modrinth's blog article on modpacks](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth).
